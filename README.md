# Gen-Art-Ice-Stalactites

A generative art made through turtle about patience. Ice stalactites takes centuries to form â€“ usually the rate is less than 10cm every thousand years. The visualization below is a sped up version of the actual art which took roughly 10 mins to complete. In the grand Scheme of things 10 mins are seemingly fleeting. However, in the realm of generative art, 10 mins can be tantamount to the time it took for us a race to evolve to what we are today.
